/* 
Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers, find the smallest positive integer such that it cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of the given array set.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 7.
Input: arr[] = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 28]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
*/

here we know that the smallest subarray is 1,just take that 1 add it with each elemnt of the array till the condition arr[i]<=sub,if it dosen't then retuen sub this is your ans.
